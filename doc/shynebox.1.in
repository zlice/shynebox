.SH "NAME"
shynebox \- A lightweight window manager for the X Windowing System
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBshynebox\fR [\-rc \fIrcfile\fR] [\-no\-toolbar] [\-log \fIlogfile\fR] [\-display \fIdisplay\fR] [\-verbose] [\-sync] [\-v | \-version] [\-h | \-help] [\-i | \-info] [\-list\-commands]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBshynebox(1)\fR is a window manager that provides highly configurable window decorations, hotkeys and menus that can configure itself and launch applications\&. It can have multiple virtual\-desktops called \fBWorkspaces\fR\&. Has an optional toolbar that can show the current \fBworkspace\fR name, list of open and/or minimized running applications, a \fBsystray\fR and a \fBclock\fR with the current time\&.
.sp
Shynebox uses its own graphics class to render its images on the fly\&. By using style files, you can determine in great detail how your desktop looks\&. Shynebox styles are compatible with those of Fluxbox 1\&.3\&.7 or earlier versions, so users migrating can still use their current favorite themes\&. (See \fBshynebox\-styles(5)\fR)
.sp
Keyboard and mouse button actions can be configured in the \(oqkeys\(cq file\&. This powerful configuration file can be used to automate almost any action you may want to perform, from launching applications to moving windows around the screen\&. (See \fBshynebox\-keys(5)\fR)
.sp
Shynebox can also remember certain attributes of individual application windows and restore these settings the next time the window opens\&. (See \fBshynebox\-apps(5)\fR)
.sp
A majority of the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH) specification is supported, as well as numerous other Window Hinting standards\&. This enables features like reserving desktop space, positioning and geometry, extracting window image\-icons and other hints that allow help windows to interact with each other\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-display\fR \fIdisplay\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.SH "STARTING SHYNEBOX"
.sp
\fBshynebox(1)\fR comes with a script called \fBstartshynebox(1)\fR, usually located wherever you installed shynebox\&. This script provides a bootstrap to setup and launch shynebox with a per\-user \fBstartup\fR script located in \fB~/\&.shynebox/startup\fR\&. To actually call shynebox and begin using it, you should place \(lqexec startshynebox\(rq in your \fB~/\&.xinitrc\fR, \fB~/\&.xsession\fR, or xsession script such as \fB/usr/share/xsessions/shynebox\&.desktop\fR, as the last executed command\&. Also, you may want to launch with \fIdbus\-run\-session\fR\&. Then the environment variable \fBDBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\fR can get picked up by other programs, or passed to them directly\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
exec dbus\-run\-session startshynebox
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
You can also rely on the \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR variable to put your configs in \fB~/\&.config/shynebox\fR\&. Documentation refers to \fB~/\&.shynebox\fR but these paths are interchangeable\&. \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is used over \fBHOME\fR when found\&. Some login and session managers may need \fBXDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR set manually\&. LXDM on my distro for example needs:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/\&.config"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A list of system wide default config files can be found with \*(Aqshynebox \-i\*(Aq\&. These are copied to users\*(Aq config directories by shynebox on first time runs\&.
.sp
On exit or restart, shynebox will save user configs in the file \fB~/\&.shynebox/init\fR\&. Config items in this file can be edited by hand, or through the \fBConfig Menu\fR described ahead\&. See the \fBCONFIG\fR section for more details\&.
.SH "USING SHYNEBOX"
.sp
On first launch shynebox will have a \fBToolbar\fR and an empty desktop\&. The desktop space can be used by other programs but shynebox itself does not have a way of configuring or using more than a background image\&.
.sp
To get you familiar with shynebox, here is a list terms and definitions for the window manager:
.SS "Root Window (Main)"
.sp
The desktop background\&. If you right\-click (mouse button 3) the desktop, you can access the \fBRoot Menu\fR\&. A middle\-click (mouse button 2) on the desktop opens the \fBWorkspace Menu\fR\&. See \fBMENUS\fR section ahead\&.
.SS "Toolbar"
.sp
The toolbar can contain the following tools:
.PP
\fBWorkspace Name\fR:
.RS 4
Name of the current active workspace\&. Left/Right click will go to the Prev/Next workspace\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBIconbar\fR:
.RS 4
List of windows managed by shynebox\&. This list can changed by
\fBIconbar\fR
in
\fBToolbar Menu\fR
section\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSystem Tray\fR:
.RS 4
Area for docked apps like chat, mail, audio, networking, etc\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBClock\fR:
.RS 4
A clock with the date in the format of
\fBstrftime\fR
(\fBdate(1)\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBButton\&.<name>\fR:
.RS 4
A generic button with customizable a label and action(s)\&. The
\fBCONFIG\fR
section has more info on custom buttons\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBSpacer_<n>\fR:
.RS 4
A spacer of pixel width n\&. (Default size 10\&.)
.RE
.SS "Workspace"
.sp
A virtual desktop that holds Windows\&.
.SS "Windows"
.sp
By default, windows should behave like they do on most desktop systems\&. Grabbing the bottom right/left grips will start resizing\&. Left\-click on the titlebar will raise and move the window\&. Double\-clicking the titlebar will \fIshade\fR it and hide the window contents while leaving the titlebar\&. Right\-clicking a titlebar will bring up a \fBWindow Menu\fR described in \fBMENUS\fR\&.
.SS "Tabs"
.sp
This has been common in browsers for a while, but as a window manager multiple applications of differing types can be put in one window\&. Shynebox allows windows to be tabbed by middle\-click\-dragging a window\(cqs titlebar out or onto another window\&. By default, tabs are located \fIinternally\fR in a window\(cqs titlebar, but can be configured to be \fIexternal\fR along side\-sections of windows\&. Configuration is discussed in \fBTAB OPTIONS\fR section\&.
.sp
You can also set up automatic grouping using the \(oqapps\(cq file or use a \fBPlacement Strategy\fR to add new windows to your current active window in a tab by default\&. See \fBGROUP SECTIONS\fR in \fBshynebox\-apps(5)\fR and \fBwindowPlacement\fR in \fBCONFIG\fR\&.
.SS "Key Bindings"
.sp
This is what makes shynebox so powerful\&. Bindings can be configured to just about anything you can imagine with the keyboard and/or mouse\&. You can configure a simple key press to an action, multiple actions, key\-modes (think \*(Aqlayers\*(Aq of a custom keyboard) and Emacs style chains\&. These key actions can have filters for which windows, workspaces, monitor(s)(heads) they do or don\(cqt act on, and can access a good amount of the internal functions of the window manager itself\&. All configured in a simple text file, for example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Alt F4 :Close
Super r :Exec sbrun
Super l :Exec xscreensaver\-command \-lock
.fi
.if n \{\

.SH "MENUS"
.sp
Shynebox has customizable popup menus and also provides menus for configuration and window manager related functions\&.
.sp
When a menu is open, you can navigate with mouse or keyboard, and even search items by name\&. Some special menu items react slightly differently depending on the mouse button you use\&. For example, some configuration items have min\-max ranges with large values where a double\-click will increase by more than a single digit\&.
.sp
Normally, activating a menu item will close a menu and its submenus\&. You can also right\-click the title area of a menu or press \(lqesc\(rq to close it without activating an item\&.
.sp
See \fBshynebox\-menu(5)\fR for customization\&.
.SS "Root Menu"
.sp
The root menu is where you can launch applications and change different aspects of shynebox\&. By default it is opened by right\-clicking on an empty area of the desktop\&.
.sp
The default Root Menu holds a special \(lqShynebox menu\(rq with these items:
