.SH "NAME"
shynebox-apps \- per\-window attribute configuration for shynebox(1)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
~/\&.shynebox/apps
.SH "SYNTAX"
.sp
Variable parameters are shown in emphasis: \fIargument\fR
.sp
All other characters shown are required verbatim\&. Whitespace is only required to delimit words, but it is fine to add more whitespace\&.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
It is possible to force an application to always have the same dimensions, position, and other settings when it is first launched\&. These settings are saved in the \(oqapps\(cq file, located by default in \fB~/\&.shynebox/apps\fR\&.
.sp
Most simple settings can be saved using the \(lqRemember\&...\(rq submenu of the window menu, which is opened with a right\-click on titlebars by default\&. More advanced features require editing the \(oqapps\(cq file manually\&.
.sp
You do not need to \(lqreload\(rq shynebox after editing the apps file, the changes should be picked up when the next window is opened\&.
.sp
The file is made up of two main types of sections, apps and groups, detailed below\&.
.SH "APP SECTIONS"
.sp
\fB[app]\fR sections provide settings for individual application windows\&.
.PP
These sections begin with a line of the format
.RS 4
\fB[app]\fR
\fB(\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB)\fR
\fB{\fR\fIcount\fR\fB}\fR
.RE
.sp
The \fIpattern\fR can be one or more patterns which match windows\&. For more details, see \fBCLIENT PATTERNS\fR\&. If you specify more than one \fIpattern\fR, they must ALL match for the settings to be applied\&.
.sp
The \fB{\fR\fIcount\fR\fB}\fR is optional\&. If specified, then the entry will only match at most that many windows at any time\&. If omitted, the default is to apply the settings to all matching windows\&.
.sp
This opening \fB[apps]\fR line is followed by any number of settings for the application\&. See \fBSETTINGS\fR for more details\&.
.PP
Each of these sections ends with the single line
.RS 4
\fB[end]\fR
.RE
.SH "TRANSIENT SECTIONS"
.sp
\fB[transient]\fR sections provide settings for "dialogs"\&.
.sp
This is the same as the \fB[app]\fR section, but applies to transient windows\&. Transient windows have a WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property\&. This will apply to all modal and several other dialogs which have a "leader" they remain above\&. Notably, open/save dialogs fall into this category\&.
.SH "GROUP SECTIONS"
.sp
The primary purpose of \fB[group]\fR sections is to group windows together\&. All windows in a group will be tabbed together automatically\&.
.PP
These sections begin with a line of the format
.RS 4
\fB[group]\fR
\fB(\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB)\fR
.RE
.sp
Where the \fIpattern\fR item is optional\&. If specified, this pattern must match for the group to take effect\&. It is common to use non\-window\-specific patterns such as \fB(workspace)\fR here\&. See \fBCLIENT PATTERNS\fR for more details\&.
.sp
This is followed by any number of \fB[app]\fR lines\&. These have a similar format to the \fB[app]\fR section detailed above in \fBAPP SECTIONS\fR, but do not contain any settings and do not have an associated \fB[end]\fR line\&.
.PP
Like this
.RS 4
\fB[app]\fR
\fB(\fR\fIpattern\fR\fB)\fR
.RE
.sp
This section may also contain settings that are applied to every window in the group\&. See the \fBSETTINGS\fR section for details\&.
.PP
As with \fB[app]\fR sections, each of these sections ends with the single line
.RS 4
\fB[end]\fR
.RE
.SH "SETTINGS"
.sp
These settings may be stored in the \(oqapps\(cq file\&. A settings line must appear inside either an \fB[app]\fR or \fB[group]\fR section\&.
.PP
The general format is
.RS 4
\fB[\fR\fIsetting\fR\fB]\fR
\fB{\fR\fIvalue\fR\fB}\fR
.RE
.sp
All allowed values are described below, except for \fIbool\fR which can simply have the value \fByes\fR or \fBno\fR, which enables or disables the associated setting, respectively\&.
.PP
\fB[Workspace]\fR {\fInumber\fR}
.RS 4
Forces the application to open on the
\fInumber\fR
workspace specified\&. Workspaces are set by number, beginning with 0\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Jump]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4
Changes the active workspace to the remembered one when the application is opened\&. This is only useful when used in conjunction with
\fI[Workspace]\fR\&. See
\fBEXAMPLES\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Head]\fR {\fInumber\fR}
.RS 4
Forces the application to open on a specific head (read: monitor\&. For XRandr multi\-monitor)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Layer]\fR {\fInumber\fR}
.RS 4
Specify the layer to open the window on (by number)\&. Each layer has a number\&. The named ones are: 1\-AboveDock, 2\-Dock, 3\-Top, 4\-Normal, 5\-Bottom, 6\-Desktop\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Dimensions]\fR {\fIwidth[%]\fR \fIheight[%]\fR}
.RS 4
Opens the application with the specified
\fIwidth\fR
and
\fIheight\fR, in pixels\&. If the value is given in percent, then the window size will be based on the current screen\(cqs size\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[IgnoreSizeHints]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4
Some Applications restrict the aspect ratio, minimum, or maximum size of windows\&. Setting this key "yes" will make shynebox ignore those constraints\&.
\fBNOTICE\fR
that bad client implementations may hard depend on these constraints (by blindly using their geometry in unsave calculations, causing div\-by\-zero segfaults etc\&.)
.RE
.PP
\fB[Position]\fR (\fIanchor\fR) {\fIX[%]\fR \fIY[%]\fR}
.RS 4
Position the application at a particular spot\&. By default the upper\-left corner is placed at screen coordinates (\fIX\fR,\fIY\fR)\&. If you specify an
\fIanchor\fR, say BottomRight, then the lower\-right corner of the window is positioned (\fIX\fR,\fIY\fR) pixels from the lower\-right corner of the screen\&. If the value is given in percent, then the coordinates will be based on the current screen\(cqs size\&.
.PP
\fIanchor\fR may be set to one of:
.RS 4
\fBTopLeft Left BottomLeft Top Center Bottom TopRight Right BottomRight\fR
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB[Deco]\fR {\fIvalue\fR}
.RS 4
.PP
Specify the decoration state\&. There are several predefined \fIvalue\fR sets:
.RS 4
.PP
\fBNORMAL\fR
.RS 4
Standard decorations
.RE
.PP
\fBNONE\fR
.RS 4
No decorations
.RE
.PP
\fBBORDER\fR
.RS 4
Like NONE except keep the X window border
.RE
.PP
\fBTAB\fR
.RS 4
Like BORDER except keep external tabs (if enabled)
.RE
.PP
\fBTINY\fR
.RS 4
Titlebar with only an iconify button
.RE
.PP
\fBTOOL\fR
.RS 4
Titlebar only
.RE
.sp
The
\fIvalue\fR
may also be a bitmask for finer\-grained control\&. The bits are, from (1<<0) to (1<<10): Titlebar, Handle/Grips, Border, Iconify Button, Maximize Button, Close Button, Menu Button, Sticky Button, Shade Button, External Tabs, Focus Enabled\&.
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB[Shaded]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4
Whether the window is Shaded (rolled\-up) or not\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Tab]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fB[FocusProtection]\fR {\fIvalue\fR [,\fIvalue\fR [, \&...]] }
.RS 4
.PP
Comma separated list of focus controlling flags\&. \fIvalue\fR may be:
.RS 4
.PP
\fBNone\fR
.RS 4
Regular behavior
.RE
.PP
\fBGain\fR
.RS 4
A new window will grab X focus as soon as it is opened\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBRefuse\fR
.RS 4
A new window will not grab X focus as soon as it is opened\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBDeny\fR
.RS 4
The window is not allowed to claim focus while it is opened\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBLock\fR
.RS 4
No window is allowed to claim the focus while this window has it\&.
.RE
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Please notice that technically, windows may still obtain the focus which
is then however reverted by the WM\&. In case you\*(Aqre very unlucky, a key
event may thus still go to the wrong window\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB[FocusHidden]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4
If enabled, the window will not appear in
\fINextWindow\fR/\fIPrevWindow\fR
lists\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[IconHidden]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4
If enabled, the window will not appear in the icon area of the toolbar\&.
.RE
.PP

\fBFocusHidden\fR
and
\fBIconHidden\fR
at the same time\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Sticky]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4
Specify if an application should be sticky (shown on all workspaces) or not\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB[Minimized]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fB[Save on close]\fR {\fIbool\fR}
.RS 4

.RE
.SH "CLIENT PATTERNS"
.PP
A \fIpattern\fR looks like this
.RS 4
\fB(\fR[\fIpropertyname\fR[!]=]\fIregexp\fR\fB)\fR
\&...
.RE
.sp
Match definitions are enclosed in parentheses \fB(\fR\&...\fB)\fR, and if no \fIpropertyname\fR is given (i\&.e\&. no \fI=\fR is found) then \fBName\fR is assumed\&. The \fIregexp\fR can contain any regular expression, or the special value \fB[current]\fR, which matches the corresponding value of the currently focused window\&. See \fIregex(7)\fR for more information on acceptable regular expressions\&.
.sp
\fIpropertyname\fR is \fBnot\fR case sensitive, whereas the \fIregexp\fR \fBis\fR\&.
.sp
You can use \fB=\fR to test for equality or \fB!=\fR to test for inequality\&.
.sp
If you specify multiple \fB(\fR\fB\fIpattern\fR\fR) arguments, this implies an AND condition \- all patterns must match\&. For example, match on urxvt terminals that are also minimized:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
(name=urxvt) (minimized=yes)
.fi
.if n \{\
