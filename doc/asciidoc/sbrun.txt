NAME
----
sbrun - display run dialog window

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sbrun* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*sbrun(1)* is basically equivalent to the ``Run...'' dialog in other desktop
environments. This means that it is an easy way to start a program that isn't
contained in the menu (or needs a special set of parameters for this particular
invocation).

Pressing ``Enter'' will close the window and execute the command in your present
*$SHELL*. Pressing ``Esc'' will close the window and does not execute anything.

Another way sbrun can be useful is to be called from the menu with a
preloaded command line that you can edit and then execute. An example might be
sshing to a very long host name with lots of options of which one changes all
the time. In this case, you could add an entry for sbrun to your menu that
contains all the options and the host name. When you use said entry, you
could edit the line as necessary and execute it.
