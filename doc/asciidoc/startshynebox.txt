NAME
----
startshynebox - start a shynebox session

SYNOPSIS
--------
*startshynebox*

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*startshynebox* is a script which runs the file *~/.shynebox/startup* If it
doesn't exist it will be generated.

*startshynebox* should be started from your *\~/.xinitrc* if you use startx, or
 *~/.xsession* if you run a display manager, like xdm.

FILES
-----
*~/.shynebox/startup*::
    This file contains all commands that should be executed before shynebox is
    started. The initial file contains helpful comments for beginners. It also
    starts shynebox.

EXAMPLES
--------
The default *~/.shynebox/startup* is as follows:
....
#!/bin/sh
#
# shynebox startup-script:
#
# Lines starting with a '#' are ignored.

# Change your keymap:
xmodmap "$HOME/.Xmodmap"

# Applications you want to run with shynebox.
# MAKE SURE THAT APPS THAT KEEP RUNNING HAVE AN ''&'' AT THE END.
#
# unclutter -idle 2 &
# wmnd &
# wmsmixer -w &
# idesk &

# And last but not least we start shynebox.
# Because it is the last app you have to run it with ''exec'' before it.

exec shynebox
# or if you want to keep a log:
# exec shynebox -log "$shynedir/log"
....

If you need to start applications after shynebox, you can change the *exec
shynebox* line above to something like this:
....
eval "(sleep 5s ; killall openrgb)" &
exec shynebox
....
This will allow openrgb to change LED settings and then kill it after
things have had a second to take effect.

For more details on what else you can do in this script, see *sh(1)*, or the
documentation for your shell.
