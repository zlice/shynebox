NAME
----
sbsetbg - Set a background wallpaper or pattern

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sbsetbg* [*-uU* 'wallpapersetter'] [*-fFcCtTaA*] 'wallpaper'

*sbsetbg* [*-uU* 'wallpapersetter'] *-rR* 'path'

*sbsetbg* *-bB* 'sbsetrootoptions...'

*sbsetbg* [-*l*|*h*|*i*|*p*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*sbsetbg(1)* is a wrapper that tries to find a suitable
background-setting app and then tries to set the wallpaper using that
app. You don't have to configure sbsetbg. It just uses the first app it
can find.

Furthermore it supports remembering the last set wallpaper so you don't
have to edit the style or init-file to change the wallpaper.

It aims to provide clear error messages in a window that make debugging
problems easy.

OPTIONS
-------
*-f* 'file'::
Set fullscreen wallpaper.

*-c* 'file'::
Set centered wallpaper.

*-t* 'file'::
Set tiled wallpaper.

*-a* 'file'::
Set maximized wallpaper, preserving aspect (if your bgsetter
doesn't support this option sbsetbg falls back to *-f*).

*-u* 'wallpapersetter'::
Use specified wallpapersetter, use no argument to forget.

*-b* 'sbsetrootoptions'::
Forward the options to *sbsetroot(1)*. These can be used to set a solid,
pattern, or gradient background texture.

*-r* 'directory'::
Set random wallpaper from a directory.

*-F*, *-C*, *-T*, *-A*, *-U*, *-B*, *-R*::
Same as the lowercase option but without remembering.

*-l*::
Set previous wallpaper. Or, if the random feature was last used,
set another random wallpaper from the same directory.

*-i*::
Display useful information about best wallpapersetter found.

*-p*::
Display some useful tips.

*-h*::
Display a help message.

FILES
-----
*~/.shynebox/lastwallpaper*::
In this file the wallpaper you set will be stored, for the *-l* option.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*wpsetters*::
Wallpapersetters to use. This can be a space-delimited list of the applications
to try, or just a single name.

*DISPLAY*::
The display you want to set the wallpaper on.

EXAMPLES
--------
To use *feh(1)* as wallpapersetter and set *wallpapper.jpg* from the current
directory as wallpaper.

    $ wpsetters=feh sbsetbg wallpaper.jpg

Recall the last set wallpaper on display *:0.0* with the stored options.

    $ DISPLAY=:0.0 sbsetbg -l

BUGS
----
*sbsetbg(1)* is not foolproof. Do not run quickly in succession, or
lastwallpaper may get duplicate lines and start causing issues.
