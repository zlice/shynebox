NAME
----
shynebox - A lightweight window manager for the X Windowing System

SYNOPSIS
--------
*shynebox* [-rc 'rcfile']
           [-no-toolbar]
           [-log 'logfile']
           [-display 'display']
           [-verbose]
           [-sync]
           [-v | -version]
           [-h | -help]
           [-i | -info]
           [-list-commands]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*shynebox(1)* is a window manager that provides highly configurable window
decorations, hotkeys and menus that can configure itself and launch applications.
It can have multiple virtual-desktops called *Workspaces*. Has an optional
toolbar that can show the current *workspace* name, list of open and/or
minimized running applications, a *systray* and a *clock* with the current time.

Shynebox uses its own graphics class to render its images on the fly. By using
style files, you can determine in great detail how your desktop looks.
Shynebox styles are compatible with those of Fluxbox 1.3.7 or earlier versions,
so users migrating can still use their current favorite themes.
(See *shynebox-styles(5)*)

Keyboard and mouse button actions can be configured in the `keys' file.
This powerful configuration file can be used to automate almost any action
you may want to perform, from launching applications to moving windows
around the screen.
(See *shynebox-keys(5)*)

Shynebox can also remember certain attributes of individual application
windows and restore these settings the next time the window opens.
(See *shynebox-apps(5)*)

A majority of the Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH) specification is supported,
as well as numerous other Window Hinting standards. This enables features like
reserving desktop space, positioning and geometry, extracting window image-icons
and other hints that allow help windows to interact with each other.

    not tested. Recommend to use XRandr).
////////////////
*-verbose*::
    Print more information in process.
*-sync*::
    Synchronize with the X server for debugging.
*-list-commands*::
    Lists all available internal commands (most of these are mapped
    with the `keys' file).

STARTING SHYNEBOX
----------------
*shynebox(1)* comes with a script called *startshynebox(1)*, usually located
wherever you installed shynebox. This script provides a bootstrap to setup
and launch shynebox with a per-user *startup* script located in
*\~/.shynebox/startup*. To actually call shynebox and begin using it, you
should place ``exec startshynebox'' in your *\~/.xinitrc*, *~/.xsession*, or
xsession script such as */usr/share/xsessions/shynebox.desktop*, as the last
executed command. Also, you may want to launch with 'dbus-run-session'.
Then the environment variable *DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS* can get picked
up by other programs, or passed to them directly.

    exec dbus-run-session startshynebox

You can also rely on the *XDG_CONFIG_HOME* variable to put your configs
in *\~/.config/shynebox*. Documentation refers to *~/.shynebox* but these
paths are interchangeable. *XDG_CONFIG_HOME* is used over *HOME* when found.
Some login and session managers may need *XDG_CONFIG_HOME* set manually.
LXDM on my distro for example needs:

    export XDG_CONFIG_HOME="$HOME/.config"

A list of system wide default config files can be found with \'shynebox -i'.
These are copied to users' config directories by shynebox on first time runs.

On exit or restart, shynebox will save user configs in the file
*~/.shynebox/init*. Config items in this file can be edited by hand,
or through the *Config Menu* described ahead.
See the *CONFIG* section for more details.

USING SHYNEBOX
-------------
On first launch shynebox will have a *Toolbar* and an empty desktop.
The desktop space can be used by other programs but shynebox itself
does not have a way of configuring or using more than a background image.

To get you familiar with shynebox, here is a list terms and definitions
for the window manager:

Root Window (Main)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The desktop background. If you right-click (mouse button 3) the desktop,
you can access the *Root Menu*. A middle-click (mouse button 2) on the
desktop opens the *Workspace Menu*. See *MENUS* section ahead.

Toolbar
~~~~~~~
The toolbar can contain the following tools:

--
*Workspace Name*:;;
    Name of the current active workspace.
    Left/Right click will go to the Prev/Next workspace.
*Iconbar*:;;
    List of windows managed by shynebox.
    This list can changed by *Iconbar* in *Toolbar Menu* section.
*System Tray*:;;
    Area for docked apps like chat, mail, audio, networking, etc.
*Clock*:;;
    A clock with the date in the format of *strftime* (*date(1)*).
*Button.<name>*:;;
    A generic button with customizable a label and action(s).
    The *CONFIG* section has more info on custom buttons.
*Spacer_<n>*:;;
    A spacer of pixel width n. (Default size 10.)
--

Workspace
~~~~~~~
A virtual desktop that holds Windows.

Windows
~~~~~~~
By default, windows should behave like they do on most desktop systems.
Grabbing the bottom right/left grips will start resizing. Left-click on the
titlebar will raise and move the window. Double-clicking the titlebar will
'shade' it and hide the window contents while leaving the titlebar.
Right-clicking a titlebar will bring up a *Window Menu* described in *MENUS*.

Tabs
~~~~
This has been common in browsers for a while, but as a window manager
multiple applications of differing types can be put in one window.
Shynebox allows windows to be tabbed by middle-click-dragging a window's
titlebar out or onto another window. By default, tabs are located
'internally' in a window's titlebar, but can be configured to be
'external' along side-sections of windows.
Configuration is discussed in *TAB OPTIONS* section.

You can also set up automatic grouping using the `apps' file or use
a *Placement Strategy* to add new windows to your current active window
in a tab by default.
See *GROUP SECTIONS* in *shynebox-apps(5)* and *windowPlacement* in *CONFIG*.

Key Bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is what makes shynebox so powerful. Bindings can be configured to just
about anything you can imagine with the keyboard and/or mouse. You can
configure a simple key press to an action, multiple actions, key-modes
(think \'layers' of a custom keyboard) and Emacs style chains. These key
actions can have filters for which windows, workspaces, monitor(s)(heads)
they do or don't act on, and can access a good amount of the internal
functions of the window manager itself.
All configured in a simple text file, for example:

    Alt F4 :Close
    Super r :Exec sbrun
    Super l :Exec xscreensaver-command -lock

The default bindings set up by shynebox are as follows:

Mouse clicks on the empty desktop::

    - *Left-click* (Button 1): hides all shynebox menus
    - *Middle-click* (Button 2): shows the Workspace Menu
    - *Right-click* (Button 3): shows the Root Menu

Mouse gestures on a window::

    - *ALT+Drag Left-click* anywhere on a window starts moving
    - *ALT+Drag Right-click* anywhere on a window starts resizing

Mouse gestures on a window's titlebar::

    - *Middle-click-drag* on a window's titlebar to start attaching
      to another window's tab group
    - *Double Left-click* on a window's titlebar shades the window
      (hides the window contents but leaves the titlebar)
    - *Right-click* on a window's titlebar pops up the *Window Menu*

Keyboard bindings::

    - *ALT+Tab* / *ALT+Shift+Tab*: Cycle through windows (forward/backward)
    - *WIN+Tab* / *WIN+Shift+Tab*: Cycle through tabs
    - *WIN+1/2/3*: Select the 1st -> 3rd tab in the current window
      (only 3 enabled by default)
    - *ALT+F1*: Run *xterm(1)* to open a new terminal
    - *ALT+F2*: Run *sbrun(1)* small ``run program'' dialog
    - *ALT+F4*: Close the current window
    - *ALT+F5*: Kill the current window (like *xkill(1)*, disabled by default)
    - *ALT+F9*: Minimize (iconify) the current window
    - *ALT+F10*: Maximize the current window
    - *ALT+F11*: Fullscreen the current window
    - *ALT+Space*: Open the *Window Menu*
    - *CTRL+ALT+Del*: Exit shynebox (log out)
    - *CTRL+ALT+Left/Right*: Go to the previous/next workspace
    - *WIN+Left/Right*: Send the current window to the previous/next
        workspace, but remain on this workspace
    - *CTRL+WIN+LeftRight*: Take the current window to the previous/next
        workspace, and switch to that workspace
    - *CTRL+F1/F2/F3/F4*: Switch to the 1st -> 4th workspace
    - *WIN+F1/F2/F3/F4*: Send the current window to a specific workspace
    - *CTRL+WIN+F1/F2/F3/F4*: Take the current window to a specific workspace

See *shynebox-keys(5)* for more details.

MENUS
-----
Shynebox has customizable popup menus and also provides menus for
configuration and window manager related functions.

When a menu is open, you can navigate with mouse or keyboard, and even search
items by name. Some special menu items react slightly differently depending
on the mouse button you use. For example, some configuration items have min-max
ranges with large values where a double-click will increase by more than a
single digit.

Normally, activating a menu item will close a menu and its submenus. You can
also right-click the title area of a menu or press ``esc'' to close it without
activating an item.

See *shynebox-menu(5)* for customization.

Root Menu
~~~~~~~~~
The root menu is where you can launch applications and change different
aspects of shynebox. By default it is opened by right-clicking on an
empty area of the desktop.

The default Root Menu holds a special ``Shynebox menu'' with these items:

*Configure*:::
    For customizing the behavior and certain items of shynebox.
    See *Configure Menu* section below for more details.

*System Styles*:::
    A list of system installed themes in *@pkgdatadir@/styles/*.
    Changing themes takes effect immediately. (*STYLES* section ahead).

*User Styles*:::
    A list of themes in a user specific directory (*\~/.shynebox/styles*
    and *~/.config/shynebox/styles*).

*Workspace List*:::
    Workspaces and windows, detailed below in *Workspace Menu*.

*Reload config*:::
    Use this to reload the shynebox configuration files. You must do this after
    editing the `keys' file, `init' file, or the current style.

*Restart*:::
    Restarts a completely new shynebox process while leaving everything running.
    Rereads files and redraws all graphical elements. Running applications will
    be restored to the same workspaces they were previously in. This is useful
    to do after testing multiple re-configs or styles.

*Exit*:::
    Exits shynebox, which in turn either shuts down the X Window server or
    returns you to the graphical login screen.

Configuration Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This menu does exactly what it sounds like, configures shynebox. It contains
many options which can be altered manually in the `init' file, but this is an
easier and faster way to change the most common settings and see the effects
on the fly.

All changes take effect immediately and update your config file.

*Focus Model*:::
    Lets you configure the window focus model.
    For details, see *FOCUS MODEL*, below.

*Maximize Options*:::
    Behavior of maximized/maximizing windows.
+
--
    *Full Maximization*:;;
        Allows windows to maximize over screen space reserved by the toolbar
        or other docked windows (like panels).
    *Ignore Resize Increment*:;;
        Ignores ``resize increment'' request of terminals and other windows.
        These request tell a window manager to keep a window size to a specific
        ratio for text or video rendering.
    *Disable Moving* / *Disable Resizing*:;;
        Maximized windows will ignore move/resize commands.
--

*Tab Options*:::
    Lets you configure the properties of tabs.
    Detailed in *TAB OPTIONS*, below.

*Toolbar*:::
    Lets you configure the toolbar.
    See the *Toolbar Menu* section, below.

*Opaque Window Moving*:::
    If enabled, you will see the window content while dragging it.
    Otherwise only an outline of the window will be shown.

*Opaque Window Resizing*:::
    If enabled, you will see the window content while resizing it.
    Otherwise only an outline of the window will be shown.

*Warp Horizontal / Warp Vertical*:::
    Enables dragging windows from one workspace to another. When warping,
    lower-numbered workspaces are up and/or left, and higher-numbered
    workspaces are down below and/or right.

Window Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the menu accessed by right-clicking on a titlebar.

To customize this menu, see the *WINDOW MENU* section of *shynebox-menu(5)*.

By default, this menu contains:

*Shade*:::
    Toggles shade on a window (display only titlebar).

*Stick*:::
    Toggles sticky attribute of a window.
    A `stuck' window will always be displayed on all workspaces.

*Iconify*:::
    Toggles Minimized (Iconified) state of a window.

*Maximize*:::
    Toggles Maximization of a window. You can use the different mouse
    buttons for the following:

    - Button 1  (Un)Maximize as normal.
    - Button 2  (Un)Maximize window vertically.
    - Button 3  (Un)Maximize window horizontally.

*Set Title*:::
    Change the title of a window. This will not update until manually
    changed back to an empty string. Then new updates will change
    the title again.

*Raise*:::
    Raise the window above other windows in the same layer.

*Lower*:::
    Lower the window below other windows in the same layer.

*Send To...*:::
    Send window to another workspace.

*Layer...*:::
    Change the layer of this window. See *LAYERS* for more details.

*Remember...*:::
    Specify which window settings should be stored in the `apps' file and
    remembered the next time this window is opened.
    These settings are covered in more detail in *shynebox-apps(5)*.

*Close*:::
    Close the application softly.

Workspace Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default the workspace menu can be found, by middle-clicking on the
desktop or under the *Root Menu* -> Shynebox Menu and contains:

*Icons*:::
    This menu shows any iconified (minimized) windows. Clicking on a
    window will take you to its workspace and raise it.

*Workspaces*:::
    Each workspace is shown as a submenu containing a list of all open
    windows on that workspace. Clicking on a window will take you to it
    and raise it.

*New Workspace*:::
    Adds a new workspace to the end of the list of current workspaces.
    Workspaces without names in your `init' config will be named by
    their number-id and added to your config.

*Edit current workspace name*:::
    Pops up a dialog to change the name of the current workspace.

*Remove Last*:::
    Remove the last workspace in the list. Any windows currently
    there will be sent to the workspace before it.
    This does not change your config file.

Toolbar Menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This menu can be found in the *Configuration Menu*.

All changes take effect immediately on the following:

*Visible*:::
    Sets the toolbar either to visible or invisible.

*Auto hide*:::
    This hides the toolbar until the mouse is in its designated area
    and then re-hides when the mouse leaves the area.
    See *CONFIG* for *autoRaiseDelay* delay time.

*Auto raise*:::
    If this is enabled the toolbar will raise its layer after the mouse pointer enters
    for a period of time. It will lower when the cursor leaves the toolbar.
    See *CONFIG* for *autoRaiseDelay* delay time.

*Toolbar width percentage*:::
    The percentage width of the toolbar in relation to the total size of the
    screen/monitor. Use left/right clicks to de/increase the value from 1-100.

*Claim Space*:::
    Enabling this option will reserve screen space for the toolbar.
    This space (called a strut) will not allow windows to maximize over the
    area or new windows to be placed over/under the toolbar.

*Layer...*:::
    This sets the layer on which the toolbar is set.
    (By default the toolbar is on DOCK or "Always on top" of windows.)

*Head to place toolbar*:::
    Which head (monitor) the toolbar should use. By default it is on the
    first (primary) monitor. Head 0 goes across all screen space.

*Placement*:::
    What edge or corner of the screen the toolbar is placed.

*Iconbar*:::
    Configures how the Iconbar behaves.
+
The first section changes what types of windows will be shown in the Iconbar:
+
--
*None*:;;
    Will not show any windows.
*Icons*:;;
    Shows only minimized/iconified windows on all workspaces.
*NoIcons*:;;
    Shows only un-minimized windows on all workspaces.
*WorkspaceIcons*:;;
    Shows only minimized windows on the current workspace.
*WorkspaceNoIcons*:;;
    Shows windows on the current workspace that are not iconified.
*Workspace*:;;
    Shows all windows on the current workspace. (default)
*All Windows*:;;
    Shows all windows on all workspaces.

--
+
The next section specifies the alignment of the window names shown in the
iconbar. The *Left/Right/Center* alignments will have a static width that
is specified in the `init' file under *iconbar.iconWidth*:
+
--
*LEFT*:;;
    All icons will be left-aligned.
*CENTER*:;;
    All icons will be center-aligned.
*RELATIVE*:;;
    All icons will be sized evenly and fill the iconbar completely.
*RELATIVESMART*:;;
    The iconbar will be filled completely but icons with long titles will be larger.
*RIGHT*:;;
    All icons will be right-aligned.

--
+
The last option in this submenu is:
+
*Show Pictures*:;;
    If enabled the iconbar will show the application's icon (if provided by the
    application).

*Clock*:::
    Toggles 12h / 24h notation (00:00am - 11:59pm and 00:00 - 23:59)

*Edit Clock Format*:::
    Pop up a dialog window to change the clock format in *strftime* time
    (*date(1)*).

FOCUS MODEL
-----------
The Focus Model defines how windows gain focus (i.e. become the active
window, which receives keyboard events). The focus model can be changed
in the *Configuration Menu*.

Window and tab focus can behave separately. Each of has two options:
follows mouse and click to focus. Follows mouse means that windows will
gain focus when the mouse moves over them. Click to focus (default) means
that windows will gain focus when left-clicked.

Window focus:

*Click To Focus*::
    Click to focus windows.
*Mouse Focus*::
    Window focus follows mouse.
*Mouse Focus (Strict)*::
    Like Mouse Focus, but no mouse movement is required, ie. the window is
    also focused if it moves below the mouse, eg. because it shows up or you
    change the virtual desktop.

Tab focus:

*ClickTabFocus*::
    Click to focus tabs.
*MouseTabFocus*::
    Tab focus follows mouse.

Additional settings in the ``Focus Model'' menu:

*Focus New Windows*::
    If enabled, a new window will grab X focus as it is opened.

*Keep head*::
    Refers to how focus reverts with multi-monitor setups.
    See *focusSameHead* in *CONFIG* below.

*Auto Raise Windows*::
    If enabled, focusing on a new window will automatically raise that window
    above all others within its layer. When disabled, you must explicitly raise
    a focused window using the window menu, keybinding, or *Click Raises*.

*Click Raises*::
    If enabled, left-clicking on a window will raise it above all
    other windows in the same layer.

TAB OPTIONS
-----------
Tab options for the following:

*Placement*::
    Where external tabs will be positioned relative to the
    window. For these options to work, `Tabs in Titlebar' must be off.

*Tabs in Titlebar*::
    Places tabs in window titlebars and the width is evenly divided
    between tabs like `Iconbar Relative' alignment.

*Maximize Over*::
    When this option is on, maximizing a window will ignore the size and
    location of external tabs, which means they may be pushed out of the
    screen entirely and not viewable, or over to other monitors.

*Show Pictures*::
    If enabled the tabs will show the application's icon (if provided by the
    application).

*External Tab Width*::
    Specifies the width of external tabs in pixels. External tabs have
    the same behavior as Iconbar static sized alignments.

STYLES
------
Shynebox enables you to use simple text files to specify colors, textures,
pixmaps and fonts, and thus the look of the entire window manager.

The default installation of shynebox provides some of these style files,
courtesy of Blackbox and Fluxbox. See *shynebox-style(5)*.

Style Overlay
-------------
The overlay file specified by *styleOverlay* (*~/.shynebox/overlay*
by default) can be used to override items for all styles.
This is useful for setting background or font settings.

LAYERS
------
Layers control the way that windows overlap each other. This is already
how windows work on other desktops, but some desktops only have 1 layer
where windows reside. Windows on a higher layer will always appear above
those on lower ones, whether focused or not. A window's layer can be
controlled through hotkeys or the *Window Menu* `Layer ...' submenu.
This menu gives 6 layer choices by name. These are (from highest to lowest):

* 1 - Above Dock
* 2 - Dock
* 3 - Top
* 4 - Normal
* 5 - Bottom
* 6 - Desktop

Shynebox uses 7 layers. The special "7th" layer (layer 0) is reserved for
menus, which should always be viewable to the user.

CONFIG
------
Shynebox creates a default config file (*~/.shynebox/init*) if it does not
exist. You can use the *Configure Menu* above to set most of these options.
However, there are some options not available in the menu and some that can
only be created by a user. If you edit this file while shynebox is running,
you 'MUST' ``reconfigure'' to load these changes. Setting anything through
the menu, or exiting/restarting shynebox will save the running config,
overwriting any manual changes.

These are the config items in the order they are saved in the file:

*appsFile*: 'location'::
    Location of persistent application settings.
    See *shynebox-apps(5)* for details.
+
Default: *~/.shynebox/apps*

*autoRaiseDelay*: 'integer'::
    The delay in milliseconds before focused windows or toolbar
    will raise when using their autoRaise options (or autoHide).
+
Default: *0*

*autoRaiseWindows*: 'boolean'::
    Automatically raises any window that gains focus.
+
Default: *true*

*cacheLife*: 'minutes'::
    How long shynebox keeps unused pixmaps in memory.
+
Default: *5*

*cacheMax*: 'KbSize'::
    How much memory shynebox uses to cache pixmaps.
    (Setting this too high may cause issues, or even crashes.)
+
Default: *2000*

*clickRaisesWindows*: 'boolean'::
    Causes left-clicks on a window to bring it above other windows.
+
Default: *true*

*clientMenu.usePixmap* 'boolean'::
    Controls showing image-icons of applications in ClientMenus
    (non-minimized window list menus).
+
Default: *true*

*colPlacementDirection*: *TOPBOTTOM* | *BOTTOMTOP*::
    Controls the column direction in which windows are tiled using the
    Col/RowSmartPlacement strategy.
+
Default: *TOPBOTTOM*

*colorsPerChannel*: 'integer'(2-6)::
    This tells shynebox how many colors to take from the X server on
    pseudo-color displays. A channel would be red, green, or blue. Shynebox
    will allocate this variable ^ 3 and make them always available. When you
    run shynebox on an 8bpp display, you must set this resource to 4.
    (Recommend leaving alone.)
+
Default: *4*

*defaultDeco*: 'string'::
    Specifies the default window decorations, according to the same options
    available to the *[Deco]* option in the `apps' file, see *shynebox-apps(5)*.
+
Default: *NORMAL*

*doubleClickInterval*: 'integer'::
    Adjust the delay in milliseconds between mouse clicks for shynebox to
    consider a double click.
+
Default: *250*

*edgeResizeSnapThreshold*: 'integer'::
    'Snap' to edges of screen, monitor, other windows and tabs while resizing
    for easier placement. This variable is the distance (in pixels) at which
    the resize will jump to edges.
    When 0 resize snapping is considered disabled.
+
Default: *0*

*edgeSnapThreshold*: 'integer'::
    'Snap' to edges of screen, monitor, other windows and tabs while moving
    for easier placement. This variable is the distance (in pixels) at which
    the move will jump to edges.
    When 0 resize snapping is considered disabled.
+
Default: *0*

*focusModel*: 'CLICKFOCUS' | 'MOUSEFOCUS' | 'STRICTMOUSEFOCUS'::
    Controls how windows gain focus via the mouse. With 'CLICKFOCUS', the user must
    click on the window. With 'MOUSEFOCUS', windows gain focus whenever the mouse moves
    over them, but only when the mouse is moving. With 'STRICTMOUSEFOCUS', windows gain
    focus whenever the mouse enters any exposed area, even if this is due to layer
    changes, window movement, changing desktops, closing windows, etc.
+
Default: *CLICKFOCUS*

*focusNewWindows*: 'boolean'::
    Controls whether or not new windows will be focused automatically.
+
Default: *true*

*focusSameHead*: 'boolean'::
    Controls focus for new and reverting windows on multi-monitor setups. True means
    new windows will only gain focus if they are on the same head/monitor as the currently
    focused window (assuming *focusNewWindows* is enabled). Similarly, closing windows
    will focus the last focused window on the same head until there are no windows there.
    If false reverting focus by closing windows will return focus in focus order regardless
    of monitor location, and new windows will always gain focus if *focusNewWindows* is enabled.
+
Default: *false*

*fullMaximization*: 'boolean'::
    Controls if windows will maximize over the toolbar or any other
    reserved strut areas. Takes priority over *toolbar.claimSpace*.
+
Default: *false*

*iconbar.alignment*: 'position'::
    Controls placement and size items in the toolbar.
+
Default: *RELATIVE*
+
Available options:;;
- *LEFT*: Fixed width, aligned left

+
Example:;;
+
struts.<n> allows to control this for individual heads
(<n> starts counting at 0, which is ALL heads/monitors)
+
struts.0: 50,0,0,0

    Setting to false will include the external tabs in total size calculations
    for positioning and maximizing. Also determines if snapping will try
    to snap to external tab dimensions.
+
Default: *false*

*tabs.placement*: 'placement'::
    What corner or edge external tabs will be outside of windows.
    It has the same possible values as *toolbar.placement* below.

Example: "toolbar.button.test.commands: MoveTo 0 0 : : Close"
+
Will move the current window on Mouse1, do nothing on Mouse2, and
close it on Mouse3.
+
Note: that if you want to Exec anything with a ":" as an argument you
may need to make it a file script (*sh*, *py*, so on).
+
Default: *not in config*

*toolbar.button.<name>.label*: 'string'::
    A custom text label for toolbar buttons. Technically any number of
    these can be made but must have a matching entry for

For 'usePixmap' items, some programs do not provide an icon. However with
*\~/.Xdefaults* or another *xrdb(1)* file you can supply a custom icon with
something like: "Urxvt*iconFile: /path/to/some.png" then restarting shynebox
or reloading with "xrdb -merge ~/.Xdefaults".

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*XDG_CONFIG_HOME* / *HOME*::
    Shynebox uses *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME* and then *$HOME* to find the *init*
    file and to resolve config file and directory names.

*DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS*::
    Launching *startshynebox* with 'dbus-run-session' allows programs
    to pass along the *DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS* variable.

*DISPLAY*::
    When no other display was given on the command line, shynebox will
    start on the display specified by this variable.

Shynebox can also take advantage of other environment variables if they are set
before shynebox is started. For example, if *$TERM* is set, then it will be
available whenever shynebox uses the shell, such as the `keys' file
*ExecCommand* or the root menu's *[exec]* tag.
See *shynebox-keys(5)* and *shynebox-menu(5)* for details.

For more information about environment variables in general, see your
shell's manual.
