NAME
----
sbsetroot - a simple background utility used by the shynebox(1) window manager,
originally written for and by the original blackbox(1) window manager.

SYNOPSIS
--------
*sbsetroot* [-display 'display'] -solid 'color'

*sbsetroot* [-display 'display'] -mod 'x' 'y' -fg 'color' -bg 'color'

*sbsetroot* [-display 'display'] -gradient 'texture' -from 'color' -to 'color'

*sbsetroot* -help

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*sbsetroot(1)* is a utility that can control the appearance of the root
window in three ways: Either give it a solid color, or write a two
color modula pattern to it, or render a gradient texture based on two
different colors.

sbsetroot resembles *xsetroot(1)* in this functionality but it supports
multiple-screen displays, and gradient textures the same way as blackbox or
fluxbox does. It doesn't handle cursors. sbsetroot was originally part of
the Blackbox package and was carried over with the code that became Fluxbox and
then Shynebox. It was called bsetroot/fbsetroot back in those days.

If any errors are encountered, sbsetroot will use either *gxmessage(1)* or
*xmessage(1)* to inform the user of errors.

OPTIONS
-------
sbsetroot operates in three ways, you must choose one of  the  first  3
options:

*-solid* 'color'::
Sets the root window to specified color.

*-mod* 'x' 'y'::
Creates a modula pattern. You must specify *-bg* and *-fg* colors.

*-gradient* 'texturestring'::
Renders the specified texture string to the root window.
+
'texturestring' may be one of:;;
    *Horizontal  /  Vertical / Diagonal / Crossdiagonal / Pipecross / Elliptic /
Rectangle / Pyramid*
+
Select one of these texture types, they only apply when  *-gradient* is
specified.  You must also specify both a *-from* and a *-to* color.

*-display* 'display'::
Tells sbsetroot to connect to the specified display.

*-bg, -background* 'color'::
Background color.  Needed for *-mod* patterns.

*-fg, -foreground* 'color'::
Foreground color.  Needed for *-mod* patterns.

*-from* 'color'::
Start color for rendering textures.  Needed for *-gradient* patterns.

*-to* 'color'::
Ending color for rendering textures.  Needed for *-gradient* patterns.

*-help*::
Prints version info and short help text.
